This is just stub for future documentation. Documentation will be done once I develop some stable version.

Planned features:

1. Debugger for any Ruby applications (Rails, by default), using ruby-debug-ide gem.
2. Debugger will be look like in the Netbeans - you can go through the code, watch variables in separate window, set breakpoints, etc...
3. Also, it will support command-line commands, like in the rdebug, e.g., you can execute 'p "Hello World"' in command line of VIM and it will output result: "Hello World". This feature I miss in the Netbeans very much. :)

== Thanks

Special thanks to tpope (for rails.vim) and Marty Grenfell (for NERDTree), mostly, I learn Vim Scripting from their projects.
